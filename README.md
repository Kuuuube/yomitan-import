Yomitan Import is being expanded to support other EPWING dictionaries based on user demand. This is a mostly
non-technical (although laborious) process that requires writing regular expressions and creating font tables; volunteer
contributions are welcome.

## Installation and Usage

Follow the steps outlined below to import your custom dictionary into Yomitan:

1.  Download a pre-built binary for Linux, Mac OS X or Windows from the [project
    page](https://github.com/themoeway/yomitan-import/releases).
2.  Launch the `yomichan-gtk` executable after extracting the entire archive (or `yomichan` from the command line).
3.  Specify the source path of the dictionary you wish to convert.
4.  Specify the target path of the dictionary ZIP archive that you wish to create.
5.  Press the button labeled *Import dictionary...* and wait for processing to complete.
6.  On the Yomitan options page, browse to the dictionary ZIP archive file you created.
7.  Wait for the import progress to complete before closing the options page.

**Notice**: When converting EPWING dictionaries on Windows, it is important that the dictionary path you provide does
not contain non-ASCII characters (including Japanese characters). This problem is due to the fact that the EPWING
library used does not support such paths. Attempts to convert dictionaries stored in paths containing illegal characters
may cause the conversion process to fail.
